Digital Image Processing assignments including noise removal, thresholding, morphological operations, sharpening, and analysis tasks.

Question 1 – Binary Output from Input Image

Write a program that generates the output image (black/white) from the given input image.

Question 2 – Histogram Equalization, Contrast Stretching & Gamma Correction

Apply:

Histogram Equalization

Contrast Stretching

Gamma Correction with γ = 0.4, 1.0, 1.6
Write the program and discuss the results.


Question 3 – Noise Addition & Noise Removal

Add one of the following noise types to a grayscale image with user-selected parameters:

Gaussian noise

Salt-and-Pepper noise

Uniform noise
Then remove the noise using a user-selectable filter.
Discuss the results.

Question 4 – Image Restoration

Write a program that performs restoration on the given degraded image.

Question 5 – Morphological Detection

Using morphological operations, detect the sticks and circular objects separately and display them as separate images.

Question 6 – Sharpening + PSNR

Apply three sharpening methods:

Laplace

Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG)

High-Boost Filtering
Show the results and compare the differences.
Calculate the PSNR between the original and each sharpened image.
